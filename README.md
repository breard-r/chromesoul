## What is chromesoul?

Chromesoul is a NetSoul client for Google Chrome. If you don't know what NetSoul is, you probably don't need it. If you're neither a student nor an employee of any [IONIS](http://www.ionis-group.com/) school (eg: Epitech, Epita, …), all you have to know is that NetSoul is an internal messaging protocol for thoses schools.


## Why?

When you're on the PIE, you're stuck in it unless you are connected to netsoul. With multiple operating systems it's a real pain to configure a NetSoul client for each of them. That's why chromesoul is awesome: not only it's a cross-platform NS client, but the Chrome synchronisation automaticaly install and configure it everywhere you uses chrome.


## Requirements

Chrome or Chromium 25.


## Features

### Messages
At first, chromesoul's was only intended to provide an access to internet from the PIE and didn't supported messages. However, I changed my mind and decided to include this feature. Don't panic if you don't want to be disturbed, it's possible to turn it off. All you have to do is to go in your settings and uncheck the little box.

### Desktop notifications
There's a few bugs with avatars, however it works.

### State change
It's on it's way.

### Contact's status
A status indicator is available next to the contact's avatar.

### File transfer
Maybe later.

### Why do I have to enter my password on every different chrome? Isn't it shared?
Being a very sensitive data, the password isn't shared: that's the only thing you'll have to set yourself along all your chrome installations.

### Are my data stored encrypted?
By default, no. That's why you are strongly encouraged to configure Chrome to [encrypt all your synced data](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1181035). Please note that it's true for every single application you uses.
