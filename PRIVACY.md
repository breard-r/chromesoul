## Privacy policy

Chromesoul is an instant messaging client, hence you need to supply your identification information in order to connect to the server. Your password is stored in Chrome's local storage and is not shared with anyone else than the server you want to connect to. Your login and contact list are stored in Chrome's synced storage, which implies that if you are logged in with a Google account, it will be shared with others Chrome browsers where you are logged in with your Google account. You can read more about how Google encrypts the synced data: [set or change a sync passphrase](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1181035)

In order to protect your privacy, Chromesoul does not log any conversation or activity and does not retrieve any analytic data. However, the server you connect to is not edited, maintained or affiliated in any way with Chromesoul and therefore may follow a different privacy policy.
